# Welcome to my Project Portfolio!!

  Check out my projects above! These projects display my abilites in programming in Python, C++, HTML/CSS, and more. In addition, it displays what I understand from machine learning algorithms to concepts from
Information Technology from information architecture to using GitHub and Microsoft Azure. Down below I will have my description for some of my projects:

**S&P 500 Machine Learning Model:**

  This was a great project that helped me break into Machine Learning/AI model! The project involves programming in Python and utilizing Jupyter Notebooks to create a machine learning regression model. The model focuses on predicting outcomes based on a dataset spanning 100 years of S&P 500 data. Initially, the model was trained using the random forest algorithm, achieving an accuracy of 57%. Subsequent improvements were made by incorporating additional predictors and conducting back testing, resulting in an enhanced model performance.

**Hexapawn AI**

I utilized reinforcement learning in Python to program an AI inside a three-by-three game of chess called Hexapawn. The AI is given many moves to choose from for each scenario it's in (stored within a separate text file) and randomly chooses a move. But when the AI loses to the user, the program will go back to the last move it made and remove that move choice from the text file so that the AI doesn't make that losing move again. However, if the AI wins against the user, the program will go back to the last move it made and add a duplicate move choice to reinforce the winning moves. Over the course of many games, the AI will slowly become better and better at the game until it becomes impossible to win!!
