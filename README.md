# Welcome to my Project Portfolio!!

  Check out my projects above! These projects display my abilites in programming in Python, C++, HTML/CSS, and more. In addition, it displays what I understand from machine learning algorithms to concepts from
Information Technology from information architecture to using GitHub and Microsoft Azure. Down below I will have my description for some of my projects:

**S&P 500 Machine Learning Model:**

  This was a great project that helped me break into Machine Learning/AI model! The project involves programming in Python and utilizing Jupyter Notebooks to create a machine learning regression model. The model focuses on predicting outcomes based on a dataset spanning 100 years of S&P 500 data. Initially, the model was trained using the random forest algorithm, achieving an accuracy of 57%. Subsequent improvements were made by incorporating additional predictors and conducting back testing, resulting in an enhanced model performance.
